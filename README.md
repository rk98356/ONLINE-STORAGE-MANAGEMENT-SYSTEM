Online Storage Management System is generally defined in contrast
to physical data storage, where recorded data is stored on a hard
disk or local drive, or, alternately, a server or device connected to a
local network. The Online Storage Management System is designed
for keep the files and folders of the admin as well as user. They can
store their personal document, pictures, audios, etc. In this project
all the users are under control of admin means only the admin have
the permission to add user, deactivate user, remove user and update
user. Although users can upload their data which cannot be access by
any other users. Even admin cannot access it unless the data is not
sharable. Users can share the data with any other users and admin
by link through email. In this project admin can add only 3 users.
Each user has limited storage space i.e. 5GB. If you want extra
storage then you have to buy the premium account for this.
